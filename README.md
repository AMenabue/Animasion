# Animasion
Hybrid Animal Generator Website

This playful website lets users combine two animals to create a unique hybrid creature, complete with a fun, made-up name. 
By selecting from a list of animal icons, users reveal imaginative photo mashups that merge the chosen pair into one fantastical being.

Developed entirely in 2017 while I was in high school, Animasion represents my early exploration into web development and creative coding. 
It was a fully hand-coded project, created before AI-coding and AI-generated imagery became widespread.
